Convert JS to TS Exercise | Backend Development with Node.js Nanodegree from Udacity

# Instructions
Convert this JavaScript project to TypeScript. TypeScript is already installed and ready to go.

The index.ts file is already created but contains no TypeScript yet. There are three other files in the src/utilties folder that need attention.

string.js
numbers.js
arrays.js
Look at the package.json files to see the scripts available to run.

## You'll need to:

- Convert the file extensions
- Convert CommonJS modules to ES6 modules
- Build the code to gather TypeScript errors
- Explicitly type all functions
- Fix any other issues
